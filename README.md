# IBA-Periodic-Table
These programs are used to calculate ion scattering parameters such as cross sections, kinematic factors, energies of reaction products,
charge states of ions passing through foils, and optimum settings of accelerators to obtain beams.

The IBA Periodic Table.pptx PowerPoint file presents a plot of the table of all elements with the sensitivity, depth resolution and range 
of 5 IBA techniques.
